                <p>AgBizLogic is a suite of decision-support tools developed to help growers and landowners make data-driven choices regarding the financial and environmental impact of their farm operations. While powerful, the platform's existing interface presents usability barriers for growers, especially those with low technical experience or inconsistent usage patterns.</p>
                
                <p>Our team conducted research and testing to explore how AI-driven features and UX improvements could better support users' goals. We focused on building trust, simplifying user journeys, and enabling contextual help using large language models (LLMs).</p>

            <div class="tech-content">
                <p>Despite the capabilities of AgBizLogic, the platform has not seen widespread adoption among growers who need it most. Through interviews and testing, we discovered that many users:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Struggle to remember how to navigate AgBizLogic after periods of non-use</li>
                    <li>Avoid documentation due to its length and technical tone</li>
                    <li>Distrust AI-generated outputs, especially when sources or logic are unclear</li>
                    <li>Prefer verbal, conversational assistance rather than complex interfaces</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These barriers impact the accessibility and long-term effectiveness of AgBizLogic. Our project addressed these issues through targeted design and AI integration.</p>

            <h2>Technical Approach and Research Process</h2>
            <div class="tech-content">
                <p>Our approach combined user-centered design, AI model evaluation, and applied research methods tailored to the agricultural technology domain. We began by conducting interviews with a range of stakeholders, including Oregon growers, university faculty, and student users, to uncover common challenges and workflows associated with AgBizLogic. These conversations provided a foundation for identifying usability gaps and building user personas that shaped our design strategy.</p>
                
                <p>In parallel, we reviewed academic and industry literature on AI explainability, conversational user interfaces, and technology adoption in agriculture. This informed both the structure of our prototype and our model evaluation criteria. To test AI assistant integration without building a full backend, we used a Wizard-of-Oz protocol. Participants interacted with simulated chatbot responses, generated by three different large language models(ChatGPT, Claude, and DeepSeek) without knowing which model produced each response. These sessions were followed by surveys that collected data on participants' preferences, perceptions of trust, and suggestions for improvement.</p>
                
                <p>On the technical side, we used Figma to develop interactive chatbot prototypes and redesigned user flows. We also used pdfplumber and Tesseract to analyze the structure and readability of AgBizLogic's existing documentation, helping us understand why users found it difficult to follow. Post-test feedback was collected and analyzed using Google Forms and Sheets, allowing us to identify patterns in user behavior and align design decisions with real-world needs.</p>

        <section class="findings" id="findings">
            <h2>Key Findings from User Testing</h2>
            <div class="tech-content">
                <p>User testing revealed several critical insights about how growers and other stakeholders interact with AI and decision-support tools in the agricultural domain. One of the most consistent patterns was a strong preference for responses that were brief, clear, and free of jargon. Among the models tested, DeepSeek consistently outperformed the others, with participants citing its structured and straightforward style as easier to follow and more trustworthy. Responses that were too verbose or abstract, especially those that introduced new terminology, were rated significantly lower.</p>
                
                <p>Participants also expressed a clear desire for help systems that were embedded directly into the workflow. Rather than reading through long manuals or navigating external help pages, users preferred contextual, inline guidance that appeared as they worked through their tasks. This preference reinforced the importance of designing support systems that reduce friction and cognitive load. Transparency also played a key role in building trust. Users wanted to understand where an AI-generated answer came from and how it was constructed, especially when it involved financial or environmental recommendations.</p>
                
                <p>Finally, we found that simplifying menus and providing visual cues, such as flow diagrams or step-by-step guides, made it easier for users to re-engage with the tool after periods of non-use. These findings directly informed our UX recommendations and the structure of our AI chatbot prototype, helping us ensure that our designs were grounded in the actual needs and behaviors of our target audience.</p>

            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>AgBizLogic is a suite of decision-support tools developed to help growers and landowners make data-driven choices regarding the financial and environmental impact of their farm operations. While powerful, the platform's existing interface presents usability barriers for growers, especially those with low technical experience or inconsistent usage patterns.</p>
            <p>Our team conducted research and testing to explore how AI-driven features and UX improvements could better support users' goals. We focused on building trust, simplifying user journeys, and enabling contextual help using large language models (LLMs).</p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Despite the capabilities of AgBizLogic, the platform has not seen widespread adoption among growers who need it most. Through interviews and testing, we discovered that many users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Struggle to remember how to navigate AgBizLogic after periods of non-use</li>
                <li>Avoid documentation due to its length and technical tone</li>
                <li>Distrust AI-generated outputs, especially when sources or logic are unclear</li>
                <li>Prefer verbal, conversational assistance rather than complex interfaces</li>

                <p>User testing revealed several critical insights about how growers and other stakeholders interact with AI and decision-support tools in the agricultural domain. One of the most consistent patterns was a strong preference for responses that were brief, clear, and free of jargon.</p>
                <p>Among the models tested, DeepSeek consistently outperformed the others, with participants citing its structured and straightforward style as easier to follow and more trustworthy. Responses that were too verbose or abstract, especially those that introduced new terminology, were rated significantly lower.</p>
